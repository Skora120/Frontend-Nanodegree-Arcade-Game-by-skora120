# Frontend-Nanodegree-Arcade-Game

My first game created for [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). Gameplay is simillar to [Frogger(by Konami)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger). I added couple features like levels and lives. More details below.

## How to run?

1. Download zip file from GIT.
2. Unzip it somewhere on your desktop.
3. Run index.html in browser(Recommended Google Chrome).

## How to play?

	
* To move player you have to use arrow keys on your keyboard.
* Movment in game is actually pretty tricky to use it smoothly.
* If you hit the bug you lose one live. When you have zero lives it means in next hit your will lose.
* In game is not actually implemented property win think of it like of endless runner but there is a simply difficult level.
* When you guide player to the top you will get to the next "level". Which means game getting harder: there is more bugs and they are running faster.
* **I bet you wont get above 9!**

## Known Bugs
* When player have level 1 and 3 lives and hit for first time bug text on HUD is getting a little bit to far to right. In next hit evrything is allright. I tried to fix it and actually fixed it a little bit but it is still happening.
