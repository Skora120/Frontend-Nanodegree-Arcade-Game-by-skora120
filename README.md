# Frontend-Nanodegree-Arcade-Game

My first game created for [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). Gameplay is simillar to [Frogger(by Konami)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger). I added couple features like levels and lives. More details below.

## How to run?

	1. Download zip file from GIT.
	2. Unzip it somewhere on your desktop.
	3. Run index.html in browser(Recommended Google Chrome).

## How to play?

	
	To move player you have to use arrow keys on your keyboard.

	Movment in game is actually pretty tricky to use it smoothly.

	If you hit the bug you lose one live. When you have zero lives it means in next hit your will lose.

	In game is not actually implemented property win think of it like of endless runner but there is a simply difficult level.

	When you guide player to the top you will get to the next "level". Which means game getting harder: there is more bugs and they are running faster.
